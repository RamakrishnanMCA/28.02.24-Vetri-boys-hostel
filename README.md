The project is entitled as “Hostel Booking System” is designed to address the growing challenges faced by hostel managers in efficiently managing hostel operations.
The growing number of educational institutions and hostels that have followed has made old manual management techniques more and more difficult. By providing a 
software solution that is specifically designed to match their demands, this initiative seeks to reduce the stress experienced by hostel managers. This project includes 
a graphical user interface (GUI) that is more user-friendly and intuitive in order to improve the user experience and get around the constraints of current technologies.
This project aims to simplify hostel management by providing a user-friendly interface for room booking, monthly payments, and leave applications with SMS notifications.
Admins can efficiently manage rooms, transactions, and resident queries, ensure smooth hostel operations. The GUI provides both hostel administrators and students with 
a smooth navigation experience by utilizing front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On the backend, the system is powered by robust server-side scripting
using PHP and a MySQL database.
